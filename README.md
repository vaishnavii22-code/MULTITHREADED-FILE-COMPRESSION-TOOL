THIS PROJECT IS MULTITHREADED FILE COMPRESSION AND DECOMPRESSION TOOL DEVELOPED IN C++ WHICH USES THE ZLIB LIBRARY. IT IS DESIGNED TO COMPRESS AND DECOMPRESS FILES EFFICIENTLY BY MAKING USE OF BOTH CHUNK BASED PROCESSING AND MULTITHREADING TO OPTIMIZE PREFORMANCE. THE PROGRAM OPERATES THROUGH A USER FRIENDLY COMMAND LINE MENU THAT ALLOWS USERS TO SELECT BETWEEN COMPRESSION, DECOMPRESSION, AND EXIT OPTIONS. IT IS CAPABLE OF HANDLING BOTH BINARY AND TEXT FILES AND WORKS BY SPLITTING THE DATA INTO MANAGEABLE CHUNKS OF 16KB EACH. THESE CHUNKS ARE THEN PROCESSED IN PARALLEL USING C++ THREADS, RESULTING IN FASTER EXECUTION ON SYSTEMS WITH MULTIPLE CORES.

THE COMPRESSION MECHANISM READS THE INPUT FILE IN BINARY MODE, CHUNK BY CHUNK. EACH CHUNK IS COMPRESSED USING ZLIB'S compress2 FUNCTION. THE MAXIMUM SIZE REQUIRED FOR STORING THE COMPRESSED DATA IS CALCULATED IN ADVANCE USING compressBound, WHICH ENSURES
