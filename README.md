THIS PROJECT IS MULTITHREADED FILE COMPRESSION AND DECOMPRESSION TOOL DEVELOPED IN C++ WHICH USES THE ZLIB LIBRARY. IT IS DESIGNED TO COMPRESS AND DECOMPRESS FILES EFFICIENTLY BY MAKING USE OF BOTH CHUNK BASED PROCESSING AND MULTITHREADING TO OPTIMIZE PREFORMANCE. THE PROGRAM OPERATES THROUGH A USER FRIENDLY COMMAND LINE MENU THAT ALLOWS USERS TO SELECT BETWEEN COMPRESSION, DECOMPRESSION, AND EXIT OPTIONS. IT IS CAPABLE OF HANDLING BOTH BINARY AND TEXT FILES AND WORKS BY SPLITTING THE DATA INTO MANAGEABLE CHUNKS OF 16KB EACH. THESE CHUNKS ARE THEN PROCESSED IN PARALLEL USING C++ THREADS, RESULTING IN FASTER EXECUTION ON SYSTEMS WITH MULTIPLE CORES.

THE COMPRESSION MECHANISM READS THE INPUT FILE IN BINARY MODE, CHUNK BY CHUNK. EACH CHUNK IS COMPRESSED USING ZLIB'S compress2 FUNCTION. THE MAXIMUM SIZE REQUIRED FOR STORING THE COMPRESSED DATA IS CALCULATED IN ADVANCE USING compressBound, WHICH ENSURES THAT SUFFICIENT MEMORY IS ALLOCATED FOR THE COMPRESED OUTPUT. A SINGLE THREAD IMPLEMENTATION, ESPECIALLY FOR LARGE FILES. AFTER COMPRESSION, THE PROGRAM WRITES EACH CHUNK'S SIZE FOLLOWED BY THE ACTUAL COMPRESSED DATA TO THE OUTPUT FILE. THIS FORMAT IS CRUCIAL FOR THE DECOMPRESSION FUNCTION TO IDENTIFY AND EXTRACT CHUNKS CORRECTLY.

DURING DECOMPRESSION, THE PROGRAM READS THE COMPRESSED FILE BACK IN THE SAME ORDER- FIRST FETCHING THE STORED SIZE OF EACH CHUNK, THEN READING THAT MANY BYTES AS THE COMPRESSED DATA. THE ORIGINAL SIZE OF EACH CHUNK IS ASSUMED TO BE 16KB, THE SAME AS DURING COMPRESSION, WHICH SIMPLIFIES MEMORY ALLOCATION FOR DECOMPRESSING. AGAIN MULTIPLE THREADS ARE USED TO PERFORM THE DECOMPRESSION OF INDIVIDUAL CHUNKS CONCURRENTLY. ONCE ALL THREADS HAVE FINISHED THEIR TASKS, THE PROGRAM WRITES THE DECOMPRESSED CHUNKS SEQUENTIALLY TO THE OUTPUT FILE. THIS DESIGN MAINTAINS THE ORIGINAL ORDER TO THE FILE CONTENT, PRESERVING ITS INTEGRITY. 

THE TOOL ALSO INCLUDES TIME MEASUREMENT USING C++'s chrono LIBRARY. EACH OPERATION- COMPRESSION AND DECOMPRESSION- IS TIMED IN MILLISECONDS, AND THE DUARTION IS DISPLAYED TO THE USER AFTER COMPLETION. THIS FEATURE PROVIDES A CLEAR INDICATION OF THE PERFORMANCE BENEFIT OFFERED BY MULTITHREADING, AND CAN HELP USERS TO ESTIMATE THE COST OF FILE PROCESSING FOR DIFFERENT FILE SIZES. ERROR MESSAGES ARE DISPLAYED IF FILES CANNOT BE OPENED OR IF THE COMPRESSION/ DECOMRESSION FAILS, MAKING THE TOOL ROBUST AND USER FRIENDLY FOR PRACTICAL USAGE.
